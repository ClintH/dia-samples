====

This is a demo of a multiplayer "pong" game using the motion sensors in mobile devices to cooperatively move the paddles for each team.

Playing
* Load [canvas.html](http://localhost:3000/dia-samples/demo-pong/canvas.html) on one computer - this computer tracks the state of the game and aggregates all the data together. Put it up on a projector or large monitor so everyone can see what is happening
* Each players loads [controller.html](http://localhost:3000/dia-samples/demo-pong/controller.html) on a mobile device
* After loading the controller, select a team
* Tilt your device to the left or right to move the paddle

The more players that join a team, the more collaboration is necessary to move the paddle.

The demo shows a few different aspects of Kattegat and sensor technology, but is far from complete.
