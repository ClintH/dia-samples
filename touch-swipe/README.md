# touch-swipe

Demo is based on [Hammerjs](http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/) events.

Background will change colour based on the velocity of the swipe, with red being the fastest.

## Things to try

* This demo only sets the red part of the colour. Can you introduce another colour component by differentiating between horizontal and vertical swipes?
* Look up the Hammer.js documentations and see what other useful gestures you could use.
