# pointer

Demo that shows how to use events: `pointerdown`, `pointerdown`. The colour of an element changes accordingly.

We also introduce the use of a timer, basically to do something after a certain amount of time passes. We use the in-built 'setTimeout' function for this. Timers can also be cancelled to prevent the scheduled code from running, we demonstrate this in the code as well.
