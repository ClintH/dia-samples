dia-samples
===========

The samples should be placed within the 'public' directory where you ran the kattegat generator.
This will be the same place as the template page is found.

The code for each sample is well-documented, and further notes are in README.md

You can grab the code on the Github website as a zip file, use a Github app, or use pre-installed git:

````
$ git clone https://github.com/ClintH/dia-samples.git
````
