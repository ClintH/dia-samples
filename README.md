dia-samples
===========

The samples should be placed within the 'public' directory where you ran the Kattegat generator.
This will be the same place as the template page is found.

The code for each sample is well-documented, and further notes are in README.md

You can grab the code on the [Github website](https://github.com/ClintH/dia-samples/) as a [zip](https://github.com/ClintH/dia-samples/archive/master.zip) file, use a Github app.

## Via git
Change to a directory where you would like to keep a copy of the samples. For example:

````
$ cd /Users/clint/code
````

Use git to clone a copy of the repository:

````
$ git clone https://github.com/ClintH/dia-samples.git
````

You can now copy this into the `BASE\public` directory for Kattegat, and hack on it there.

If the samples get updated, simply go to dia-samples subdirectory and pull changes:

````
$ cd /Users/clint/code/dia-samples
$ git pull
````
