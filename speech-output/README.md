speech-output
============

This demo shows you how to convert text to speech via ```SpeechSynthesisUtterance``` and is only supported by Chrome.
You can change the voice via the dropdown.

```SpeechSynthesisUtterance()``` is used to create a new speakable message.
```speechSynthesis()``` accepts messages and will say it out loud through your laptop speakers.

Things to try:
* Try changing the voice in code
* Can you transform the user's input in an interesting way so the computer doesn't say exactly what is typed?
* Can you link this up with the speech-input demo to have a conversation with your computer?
